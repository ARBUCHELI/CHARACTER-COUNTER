# CHARACTER-COUNTER

Code snippet that can be used for apps that need to implement the function of limiting the amout of characters that the users can type in a field (boxes for passwords, contact messages, etc.)

In the first image its possible to see how the snippet works when the box is empty (this example is configured to accept 10 characters and shows the user this feature of the code)

When the app is near to reach the limit of acceptable characters.  The app shows an alert to the user, with a red message (4 characters left).

Finally the app doesn't accept more characters and stops working.
